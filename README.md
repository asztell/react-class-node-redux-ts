# react-class-node-redux-ts

## TODO

1. ✅ Nodejs/Expressjs for backend
2. ✅ Class components
   - Default props
3. ✅ Redux for state management (sensitive data)
   - Create "containers" to separate concerns
4. ✅ Query params for non-private user selections
5. Error boundaries
6. Jest for unit testing

## NICE TO HAVE

1. Create a mapping doc between class-component/redux-based and functional-component/context-based apps
2. Cypress to add integration testing
