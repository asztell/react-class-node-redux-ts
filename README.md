# react-class-node-redux-ts

## TODO

1. ✅ use Nodejs/Expressjs for backend
2. ✅ use class components
   - default props
3. ✅ use Redux for state management (sensitive data)
   - create "containers" to separate concerns
4. ✅ use query params for non-private user selections
5. use error boundaries
6. use Jest for unit testing

## NICE TO HAVE

1. create a mapping doc between class-component/redux-based and functional-component/context-based apps
2. use Cypress to add integration testing
