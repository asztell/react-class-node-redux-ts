# react-class-node-redux-ts

## TODO

1. ✅ use node/express for backend
2. ✅ use class components
   - default props
3. use redux for state management (sensitive data)
   - create "containers" to separate concerns
4. use query params for non private user selections
5. use error boundaries
6. use Jest for unit testing

## NICE TO HAVE

1. create a mapping doc between class component / redux based and functional component / context based apps
2. use testcafe to add integration testing
